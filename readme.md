# Manage Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page template for a fictional product management tool called  **Manage** . The page is built using HTML and styled primarily with Tailwind CSS utility classes.

## Features

* **Responsive Navbar** with logo, navigation links, and a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
* **Hero Section** highlighting the productâ€™s main value proposition with a call-to-action button.
* **Features Section** showcasing key product features with numbered highlights.
* **Testimonials Section** displaying user feedback with avatars and quotes.
* **Call To Action (CTA) Section** encouraging users to get started.
* **Footer** with social media links, navigation, and a newsletter subscription form.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 for markup
* Tailwind CSS for styling (via CDN or local CSS file)
* JavaScript for interactive hamburger menu (linked externally as `js/script.js`)

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have the `css/main.css` file with Tailwind CSS styles included or uncomment the CDN link in the `<head>` section.
3. Place all images in the `/img` folder as referenced in the HTML.
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the landing page.
5. The hamburger menu functionality requires the JavaScript file `js/script.js` to be linked and loaded properly.

## Customization

* Update navigation links and text content to match your product or service.
* Replace images with your own branding and illustrations.
* Modify colors and fonts via Tailwind CSS classes or by editing the `main.css` file.
* Extend JavaScript in `script.js` for additional interactive features if needed.
